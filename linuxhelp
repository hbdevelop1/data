sudo comes in - it allows authorized users (normally "Administrative" users; for further information please refer to AddUsersHowto) to run certain programs as root without having to know the root password. 

Just remember, when sudo asks for a password, it needs YOUR USER password, and not the root account password.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maco.m/ruby
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rubygems

1) add-apt-repository adds a PPA to your list of sources, so that Ubuntu knows to look for updates from that PPA as well as from the official Ubuntu sources. Usually this is used to allow developers to provide updates more quickly than those in the official Ubuntu repositories.

2) apt-get update tells apt-get to update its database of what packages can be installed and where to install them from. In this case, apt-get will see your newly-added PPA and discover that ppa:maco.m/ruby has the newest version of rubygems that it knows about, so it will make a note to install rubygems from the PPA next time someone asks to install it.

3) apt-get install causes apt-get to find the package in its database and download and install the indicated file. In this case, it will find the rubygems package, download it from ppa:maco.m/ruby, and install it.

the format ppa:a/b will expand to https://launchpad.net/~a/+archive/b, where you can view the files and download them individually. In your case, that would be https://launchpad.net/~maco.m/+archive/ruby.

126-Java
This will install Oracle JVM and will update it when needed.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update

But if you want to install JVM manually, you should use these commands:
>tar -xzf jre-7u51-linux-i586.tar.gz
>sudo mv jre1.7.0_51/ /usr/lib/jvm/jre1.7.0_51
Then run
>sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/jre1.7.0_51/jre/bin/java
and
$ sudo update-alternatives --config java
There are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

448A-I committed, but then wanted to change the comment.
the way to change the comment depends on whether it has been pushed or not.
so i wanted to know if the commit i want to change the comment for was pushed or not. hen the question :List Git commits not pushed to the origin yet
solution
the formula is : git log <since>..<until>
>git log origin/develop..develop will list any commits that haven't been pushed to the origin's develop branch. 
>git log develop..origin/develop will list any commits that are in origin's develop but haven't been pulled into the local develop yet.
also:
>git log origin/develop..HEAD
-If <until> is supposed to be the current HEAD (the last commit on the checked out branch), then it can simply be omitted. The two dots are still required though: git log origin/master.. (same as git log origin/master..HEAD)
-This is not the best solution. Origin/master may not always the upstream branch. A better solution is to use @{u} instead of "origin/master" to indicate the upstream branch. Since HEAD is implied by default, one can leave that out too:
Outgoing changes: >git log @{u}.. 
Incoming changes: >git log ..@{u}
@{u} or @{upstream} means the upstream branch of the current branch (see git rev-parse --help or git help revisions for details).


449-checkout (set directory to) an old commit
git checkout <commithash>

449A-return back to last commit 
git checkout <branchname>

sudo
----
Always use gksu or gksudo for graphical applications like gparted and sudo for command line applications, like apt-get.


----QT
 QApplication object  manages application-wide resources and is necessary to run any Qt program that uses Qt Widgets.
For GUI applications that do not use Qt Widgets, you can use QGuiApplication instead.

QApplication a(argc, argv);
a.exec();
makes the QApplication enter its event loop.

A QObject adds several abilities to a normal C++ class:
the class name and slot names can be queried at run-time. 
It is also possible to query a slot's parameter types and invoke it.

This is somewhat similar to a rule like "don't use pointers, because you might get a memory leak" --- it's just too defensive. 
academic rules written by teachers for their students somehow doesn't seem to bother me that much.
	=i don't care about them
It's like with the Pirate Codebook - it's more a list of guidelines than actual rules.

QT XMLTreeModel
------
QDomNode gives you a node in the tree structure. QDomNode will give u a particular node, its siblings, no of children etc....
QDomElement on the other hand does not have information about the neighbors. It knows only about the given node, its attributes, tags and the text.

QStandardItemModel can be used as a repository for standard Qt data types.
QStandardItemModel can be used to provide data in any view that supports that interface (such as QListView, QTableView and QTreeView, and your own custom views)
QStandardItemModel provides a classic item-based approach to working with the model. The items in a QStandardItemModel are provided by QStandardItem.
When you want a list or tree, you typically create an empty QStandardItemModel and use appendRow() to add items to the model, and item() to access an item.
  QTreeView *tree = new QTreeView();
  QStandardItemModel model;
... fill in model
  tree->setModel( &model );

simpletreemodel is using class TreeModel : public QAbstractItemModel
to show the tree
TreeModel points to a root (of type TreeItem)
TreeItem points to a list of children
the core of simpletreemodel is :
    TreeModel model(file.readAll());
    QTreeView view;
    view.setModel(&model);
    view.show();
still to do : show how children are loaded and items relationship is done.

VLC BLU-ray mkv
--------------
from : http://askubuntu.com/questions/565516/can-linux-play-blu-rays
MakeMKV is an application that decodes Blu-ray disks and saves them to DRM-free files
it is free to use whilst in beta but requires entering a new temporary activation code every 30 days, found here: http://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1053
The marvellous thing about MakeMKV however is that it can "emulate" libaacs and libdplus – meaning any calls from apps that link to those libraries expecting the default open source decoder will instead get passed through MakeMKV's closed-source decoder – hence any video playback software which uses those libraries will automatically use MakeMKV's decoder and be able to play the latest titles.

To install and set up MakeMKV:
Step 1: Install it
(I built from source so haven't actually tried these packages myself)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:heyarje/makemkv-beta
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install makemkv-bin makemkv-oss

PARTITION
-4 primary partitions in any disk
-extended partition can contain any number of partitions (logical partitions)
-Only one extended partition may be created on a hard drive.
the extended partition can co-existing with a max of 3 primary partitions
-An Extended partition cannot be formatted with a filesystem, such as ext3, FAT, or NTFS, nor can it directly hold data. That is the function of the Logical Drives which are created within it.
-we can have one Extended partition encompassing the entire hard drive,

.NET
any language compiler that targets .NET must emit code in IL, intermediate language, rather than native processor code.
	Programming languages that target .NET emit what we call managed code. As opposed to traditional compilers, the emitted code is not native to the processor that will execute it.
The Common Language Runtime, or CLR, is the .NET runtime environment that loads and manages our .NET programs and provides them with runtime services. We'll discuss the CLR in much detail in this module.
The Framework Class Library, or FCL, provides us with the essential building blocks we need in order to build our programs.
	In order to develop our programs, we need some building blocks - we can't start writing everything from scratch every time.
	The FCL is usable by all programming languages, since the vast majority of it is CLS compliant.
The Common Type System (CTS)
The CTS specified how types in .NET are defined. The CLS is a subset of the CTS that must be supported by any .NET language.

    Defines how types are declared, used and managed
        Possible types (class, interface, etc)
        Possible type content (methods, fields, etc)
        Visibility (public, private, etc)
        More ...
    Most languages cannot support all features of the CTS
    Common Language Specification (CLS)
        Defines a subset of the CTS that must be followed by any language
        Allows cross-language integration
A redistributable package must be installed at the target machine, so the .NET runtime is present and able to execute .NET applications.

every type in .NET is either a value type or a reference type, derives directly or indirectly from System.Object
Multiple inheritance is not supported in .NET. But it can implement multiple interfaces.
the .NET type system is type safety. The CLR makes sure that we don't do anything illegal that may compromise the integrity of the program. 90
C# provides aliasing
    C#: int
    FCL: System.Int32
    IL: int32

    Value types
        Allocated in the stack (in most cases)
        Copied on assignment
        Have no size or memory management overhead
        Examples: struct, enum, most primitives (i.e. int)
    Reference types
        Allocated on the heap
        Only reference copied on assignment
        Have size overhead of 8 to 16 bytes (depending on the OS)
        Subject to garbage collection
        Examples: class, interface

.NET Constructor
class MyRefType
{
    public int Data;
}
static void Main(string[] agrs)
{
MyRefType r1 = new MyRefType();  //default constructor. 
Q-What if the constructor needs args ?

    System.Object (object in C#) is the root of all types, and classes that don't explicitly derive from anything else.
    It is a concrete (non-abstract) class
        Can be instantiated directly
        Does not require any overrides from its derived classes
    It defines method but contains no fields (data members)
    Virtual methods:
        ToString returns string representation
        Equals returns whether two objects are equal. needs overiding to do more logical equlity.
        GetHashCode returns a hash code for the object. especially useful in collection and the object is to be the key.
        Finalize called as part of garbage collection, cannot be used directly from C#
    Non virtual methods:
        GetType provides information about the type of the object
        MemberwiseClone (protected) creates a shallow copy of an object. Q-in the heap ?
    Static methods:
        ReferenceEquals checks whether two references refer to the same object
        Equals checks whether two object are equal

Conversion 1: built-in types
int num1 = 10;
short num2 = (short)num1; // possible loss of data -> explicit conversion needed

short num2 = 10;
int num1 = num2; //no loss of data possible -> no need for explicit conversion

Conversion 2 complexe: class "Convert" is offered also, for more advanced conversion options that C# doesn't provide directly
conversion 3 operators.Module 7
conversion 4. boxing
conversion vs casting : When the required conversion isn't supported, the compiler attempts to perform casting instead.
Since up-casting is safe, we can do it implicitly:
Triangle t = new Triangle();
Shape s = t;
down-casting requires a explicit cast: 
Shape s = new Triangle();
Triangle t = (Shape)s;
but the CLR verifies at runtime that the cast is indeed valid. If it isn't it throws an InvalidCastException.

01Triangle t = new Triangle();
02
03// compile time error
04Rectangle r = (Rectangle)t;
05
06object o = t;
07
08// runtime error:
09// InvalidCastException
10Rectangle r2 = (Rectangle)o;


IS
01Shape s = new Triangle();
02
03// true
04bool b1 = s is Triangle;
05
06// true
07bool b2 = s is Shape;
08
09// false
10bool b3 = s is Rectangle;
11
12// true (by definition)
13bool b4 = s is object;

01if (s is Rectangle)  //CLR does the test here
02{
03    Rectangle r = (Rectangle)s; //CLR checks if this is legal
04    // use r
05}

AS
as is more efficient. as casts if possible. The as operator combines the testing and the casting into a single operation.
01Rectangle r = s as Rectangle;
02if (r != null)
03{
04    ...
05}




type safety : can't assign a small object to a bigger one. the latter would access wrong data in memory.
class SmallType
{
    public int Field1;
}

class LargeType
{
    public int Field1;
    public int Field2;
}

...

SmallType s = new SmallType();

// won't compile:
LargeType l = (LargeType)s;


BOXING = a value type converted to object
BOXING - 1 : from a built in type
    Every type is either a reference type or a value type
    object is a reference type - refers to an object in the heap
    int is a value type - it is allocated in the stack
    Every type, including int derives from object
    Up casting (converting up the inheritance hierarchy) is legal by definition
    What happens when we cast from int to object?
    An object must refer to the heap, but the int is in the stack!
    The solution is ... BOXING

int num1 = 20;
// boxing:
object o = num1;
// unboxing:
int num2 = (int)o;

num2 is different from num1 //hb: risk of infinite creation of reference type and value type variables

BOXING - 2 : from a struct
	MyValType v1 = new MyValType();
    v1.Data = 1;
    Console.WriteLine("v1 " + v1.ToString());
    // boxing
    object o1 = v1;


BOXING - advanced - restriction
There is some restriction: Unboxing and data conversions are not allowed in a single operation. 
int num1 = 20;
object o = num1;
short num2 = (short)o; // runtime exception: throws an InvalidCastException. A boxed int must be unboxed as int.

data conversions should happen in a different instruction.

short num2 = (short)(int)o; // Once unboxed, the int can be converted to short


BOXING - advanced - performance
-boxed values might stay in the heap for a long time
-garbage collector must interven (background code to clean the heap is needed)

win8 acer linux
---------------

usb stick is not read, but win8.1 is


----------------
goal install windows
context:bios+GPT
planing:
  convert disk to mbr, or just a partition
  install windows on the mbr partition

go to uefi and gpt
  but will the usb key be read.

goal ultimate; have win8
goal:
  get the usb be read first.

try to boot from win8.1 usb   




important questions
-------------------
can an gpt disk be converted to mbr one ? and vice versa ? 207
can windows turn a legacy bios to an uefi one ? 208
how to turn an mbr to gpt ? an legacy bios to uefi ? 206
can diskpart convert from gpt to mbr ? 


you probably have a GPT partition which is what windows 8 generally uses for the UEFI rather than an MBR

options:
1-unlocking the hd
use linux tools to unlock the hd 
use bcdboot to unlock the hd
use hens' disk

0
2-update the uefi firmware (but it is only done through windows8)

3-convert (reformat) hard drive from GPT to MBR. see 203

You can also enter BIOS/UEFI and set your disk controller mode (aka SATA mode, RAID mode) to Standard (aka Standard IDE or SATA, Legacy) instead of AHCI or RAID. 
how to do this without bios/uefi

203
If you formatted or converted your system drive from MBR partitioning to GPT, you must ensure the EFI boot options state "UEFI only".

204
In old BIOS mode, Windows 8 will not detect your GPT hard drives or partitions correctly. No booting, no Refresh Your PC or Reset Your PC until "UEFI only" is set.
Windows 8 requires UEFI for GPT drives. This is a must and there is no workaround. 

If you do not have the Windows 8 installation DVD (e.g. Windows 8 came pre-installed), grab the 90-day Windows 8 Enterprise evaluation DVD from MSDN (you need to sign in with your Windows Live ID).

using diskpart, can go to GPT

Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes.

This is your system trying to boot from a network.
The most common reason for this is that it's skipping your hard drive because your hard drive is no longer bootable.

Please try one of the free hard drive tests here:  http://www.carrona.org/hddiag.html


where are drivers and manuals ?

If it's an LVM partition, you will need to deactivate it using the command lvremove which will remove the lock.
Only then can you delete the partition using gparted.
Use lvscan to view the volume.
Use lvremove to remove it.
Check man pages man lvscan and man lvremove for details.
